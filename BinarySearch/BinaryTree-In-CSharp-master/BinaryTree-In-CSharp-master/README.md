# BinaryTree-In-CSharp
Implementaion of Binary Trees in C#

  As part of the Binary tree implementation  I have included the below few mehods.
  - Insert(data) - Inserts data into Binary Tree
  - Search(data) - Search through the Binary Tree
  - GetTreeDepth() - Calculates the total height/depth of the tree from the rootNode.
  - GetInOrderTraversal() - Gets the list of nodes traversed in InOrder
  - GetPreOrderTraversal() - Gets the list of nodes traversed in PreOrder
  - GetPostOrderTraversal() - Gets the list of nodes traversed in PostOrder
  - HasPathSum(sum) - Checks whether any of the tree path (from root to leaf) equals sum.
  - DoMirro() - Changes the tree so that roles of left and right nodes are swapped at each level.
